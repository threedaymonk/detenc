Heuristically detect the encoding of a Western European text file.

Recognised encodings are US-ASCII, UTF-8, ISO-8859-15, WINDOWS-1252, and
UNKNOWN.

Usage: detenc FILENAME (FILENAME ...)

Options:
  -o  If the encoding is UNKNOWN, show the offset of the byte that didn't
      conform.
  -q  Quiet: just give the encoding for each input file; don't print the
      filename.
  -h  Show this help text.
